I have set up a Vite React app and started this project. Before getting started I installed a few packages I would be using in this project: - Headless UI - Redux Toolkit - Clsx - moment - React Icons - React Router Dom - Recharts
-Sonner
After This I created a Folder Structure with the pages I will be using in this project.

Second Commit (22-07-2024) -
After Setting up the basics require for the app, I started making my first page. I added private and public routes in the app page, then started working on login page. The page consists of two containers, One with app name and motto and the other with a login form asking for email and password. I will be changing the name and motto when something creative comes to my mind but for now let it be what it is. I also created 2 components, a textbox component and a button component, both of these components will come in handy later in the project.

Third Commit (23-07-2024) -
I created some important components which can be used throught the application. First is a Sidebar component which has all the controlls a user and a admin has access to. Second is a Navbar component which has all the navigation buttons, I also made them responsive to work smothly on the mobile device as well on the desktop. Apart form these I also setup redux toolkit and its slices.

Completed dashoboard page, added charts and users table to it. Also created 2 new components, Chart.jsx and UserInfo.jsx. Currently I am using static data and not fetching nay data from the server. But with just front end I can't get into the dashboard page because of the condition I put on login page. So the fully tested dashboard page will be available once I have set up the backend. I guess data.js file in utils folder is a temporary file and will be removed once the backend will be available.

Fifth commit - (24-07-2024) -
Completed Tasks, Trash and Users page. I created a lot of different components and reused them in all these pages. Just a few more fixes and edits on the front end then we can start working on the backend. If everything goes well front end will be completed by tomorrow.

Sixth commit - (24-07-2024) -
Front end has been completed with some bugs or set backs cause I don't have a working backend. I will start working on the backend soon, so I can address this issues and find a solution for them.
