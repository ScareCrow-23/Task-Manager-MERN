    I have set up a Vite React app and started this project. Before getting started I installed a few packages I would be using in this project:
        - Headless UI
        - Redux Toolkit
        - Clsx
        - moment
        - React Icons
        - React Router Dom
        - Recharts
        -Sonner
    After This I created a Folder Structure with the pages I will be using in this project.
